# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Quarkus codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with Quarkus including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the Quarkus community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

> // TODO

# Getting started

This application has been built with Java 11, so you need to have Java 11 and Maven installed.

You can check out the application by running 

> mvn compile quarkus:dev

To test that it works, open a browser tab at http://localhost:8080. Quarkus recompiles and reloads your application as you work on it.
